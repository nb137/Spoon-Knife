Here's the process for forking, downloading, committing

From project page, create a fork, this will bring it to your own repository

Clone or download -> grab address of repository
https://github.com/nb137/Spoon-Knife.git

git clone https://github.com/nb137/Spoon-Knife.git
(it is now downloaded onto the local drive)

[Do the editing you'd like to do (such as editing this document)]

gid add [the filename you'd like to add/update]

git commit -m 'comment for the addition'

git status
[outputs some stuff that might troubleshoot if it wont update]

git remote -v
[should list the fetch and push, in the previous case "origin" was used, and then we consider "master" as the main branch in the local drive]

git push origin master
[push the "master" branch locally to the origin (which is listed in the remote cmd output)]

now it should be online...
